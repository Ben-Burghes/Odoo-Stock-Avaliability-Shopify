wwuk_stock_availability
=======================

Provides nested stock availability for products, including BoMs, variants, etc.

Also provides a detailed Product Availability report to deep dive into the state
of a product, including (but not limited to):

- Per-warehouse stock level
- Information about child items
- Information about pending sales, purchases and transfers

Under 15.0 this work inconjunction with OCA/stock_available now that
mrp_phantom_equiv has been removed.

It depends on GlodoUK/product_commingle, etc.
